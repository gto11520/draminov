          <h3>Meet Our Workers’ Compensation Doctors</h3>
          <div className="divider"></div>
          <h5>Our specialists must fulfill specific requirements to become an authorized provider</h5>
          <p>
            It can be difficult to schedule an appointment with a doctor whom you’ve never met. In the State of New York, if you’ve suffered an injury at work that may qualify as a Workers’ Compensation issue, then you must see an authorized provider to evaluate your health. Only in an emergency situation are you allowed to visit a provider who has not been authorized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our physicians must submit an application directly to the county medical society to be authorized to treat workers’ compensation cases. Our osteopathic physicians work with the New York State Osteopathic Medical Society. To perform independent medical examinations, each of our specialists must include their specialty board certificate as well. It must be a certificate that has been recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association for the application to be considered valid.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re wanting to talk to one of our podiatrists or chiropractors, then you can have confidence that the Workers’ Compensation Board has reviewed their application. To treat a work-related podiatry issue, an approved residency program must be completed to become an authorized provider within the state.

          If you’re injured at work, then the consequences you face can become serious. Harmful workplace conditions or situations can create a permanent disability, especially if the injury is not treated right away.
