                    <h3>Injuries and Treatment</h3>
                    <p>
                        The injuries that you may suffer connected to your work can be numerous. Common injuries from accidents are soft-tissue injuries, such as sprains, strains, and pulls. Such an injury involves some type of damage to the ligaments, tendons, and muscles. These are your connective tissues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any work related injuries, which involves any part of your body, are of the most common types of injuries our clinic sees during post-accident appointments.  
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We are located on the QM18 and Q60 bus lines.</li>
                        <li>We are available at 75th Avenue (E,F) from the subway.</li>
                        <li>We offer free validated parking for those who drive to our location.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We understand that accidents are inevitable. Being involved in one can be a devastating experience, especially if you have suffered an injury during the event. Since the Workers’ Compensation law was enacted in the 1970s, insurance companies are required in New York to pay for legitimate medical expenses that are related to accidents and injuries related to your job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New York is one of only 12 states which provides Workers’ Compensation coverage.
